How to use this repo:
=====================

If you are a student in the class, you can get set up to work with this
repository by:

1) Fork this repository into your own gitHub account

2) Create a directory in the "students" directory with your name: something
   like "ChrisBarker".

3) Add a readem.rst or reame.md file in your directory with some information
   about yourself.

4) When you want to submit an assignment, do a "pull request", and the
   instructors will review your work, and merge it into this repo once it is
   satisfactory.

5) for each week or assignment, create a new directory in which to put your
   work for that assignment.
