## Dhawal Nagpal

Hi, my name is Dhawal (pronounced Duh-wal). I recently moved to the beautiful Pacific NorthWest from Orange County, CA with my wife. I grew up in India and have since lived in Connecticut, California, and now Washington.

### Interests

I love the outdoors and amazed with the natural beauty of PNW. I also like badminton and biking, although I _wish_ I had more time to do that. I also love reading **history**, **mythology** and detective fiction.

I also like [Weetabix!] (http://www.weetabix.co.uk)
