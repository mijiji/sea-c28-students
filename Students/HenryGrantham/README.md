## About Henry Grantham

### Background
I have a BS from UW in Mathematics and took about 7 computer science courses there and loved them, but when the dot com crashed, I became a paralegal because there was enormous demand there. After about 10 years as a paralegal, I would like to do something more challenging and more along the lines of my personal strangths.

### Programming Background
Started with basic on 8-bit CBM PET machines back in the 80's and then graduated to C64 Basic and a bit of machine language for many years, then learned Logo, Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, Lisp, Fortran, dBase, C, C++ back in the 90's. I then programmed a few small games in C++ and a popular 3D hovercraft racing game in quakec. In 2003, I learned Python 1 to do a project at my work. In 2010, I took 3 classes in Java and two classes in game programming at Edmonds Community college where I also learned MS VB and MS C#. I currently use html and css to maintain the website at my work.

### Why am I taking Python Foundations II
I used a previous version of Python about ten years ago to prototype a financial application and loved its elegant style and ease of use.  Preiously, I had used C++ for most of my small projects. I am taking Python Foundations II to prepare for the Python Developer Accelorator program and I hope to change professions and get back to my passion for coding.
