#Why I'm learning coding, specifically Python
I want to begin building a health content website somewhat similar in form to [Quora](www.quora.com) with participation from authority figures and including doctors.

##Hobbies
I read about 200 books a day. I have a weird habit of reading multiple books simultaneously and finishing them all at roughly the same time.  I started *The Dhandho Investor*, *Viral Loop* and *Never Eat Alone* all at once. 

####**My life philosophy is:**
>The Hard Way Is Easier
