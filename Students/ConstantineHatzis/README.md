# Assignment 1, Task 1

## Programming Background

I studied and worked as a mechanical and aerospace engineer, so the majority of my programming background is with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) to build things like models of fluid systems, feedback control systems, and solving thermodynamic problems. Basically programming to solve math and physics problems. In that time I had some exposure to C and Fortran.

Recently I taught myself the bare minimum of Java to write a deck shuffling and card choosing app for the board game Dominion.

## Why Am I Taking This Course

I want to improve my programming skills in general, learn more about how the hidden backend of the internet works, prepare for the Python development accelerator, and hopefully start a new career.

## Some of the Random Things I am Into

My bicycle, board games, space, my dogs and cats, science fiction, BJJ.
