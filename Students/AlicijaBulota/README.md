###Past Experience
------------------
I was previously enrolled in the current Python Development 
Accelorator, but found that I was not ready for the speed of 
the class given that I was accepted to the course had only 
started to learn how to code a week before the began. I am 
excited to master the basics and to take the next Dev. 
Accel. in the new year!

###Goals 
--------
Hopefully I will be on my way to becoming an excellent Python
developer and will be able to work for startup in the near future!
