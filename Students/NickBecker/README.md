#Hello!

###I'm Nick Becker!

I have spent the last few years working in Biotech here [here](http://www.iehinc.com), though before getting my degree I had spent 3 years as a cake decorator (*Trophy Cupcakes!*). I absolutely love baking and cooking and try to do both of them as often as I can. I like to spend time exploring/eating in Seattle (Bakery Nouveau in West Seattle is my favorite) and have no intentions of leaving the area. I am excited to be a part of this course, and hopefully will be in the Dev Accelerator early next year.

I spent about 6 months years ago learning HTML, and I have self taught some Python leading up to this course. My goal after spending time at CodeFellows would be to be to potentially combine my science background with Python knowledge and move towards bioinformatics, though, Python seems well suited to leave my options open. I am very excited to be a part of this class and I am looking forward to being in a classrom environment again!
