## Roadtrip that I want to do in the future.

Start from Seattle, then east on I-90 to Spokane, WA. Then from Spokane, head to Coeur D'Alene, ID.  
Then from Coeur D'Alene, head north to the border and enter Canada. Continue to Banff, AB. From  
Banff, head west to Vancouver, BC. Then finish the trip back down to Seattle.

## Something about me.

I studied environmental science and resource management. My capstone was on the online news  
sources opinions on biofuels.
