Personalized plan.

Goals:
My goals is to complete the Python Dev Accel and hopefully find a
job working in software development.

What I want do with python:
Either software development or other python related jobs would be fine.
However I would be most happy with some kind of development. I find user
related aspects and data collection interesting if that is a possibility
with python.

Python: 8
Git: 6
Data structures and algorithms: 8
HTML: 5
CSS: 1
JavaScript: 1
