#Hello!
<br />
My name is Jesse Klein. I am the guy with the white HP. I've lived in Seattle for about for years now, but I grew up in Montana. I am a programming beginner and generally a little confused by technology, but I look up to those who are good at it. I hope to someday fix the worlds broken software and help spare other frustrated people like me!

#####Interests
<br />
I enjoy travelling and vacationing. I like watersports, golf, basketball, and football, pretty much all sports in general. I also like board games, poker, and chess, pretty much all mental games. My favorite foods are Italian, Japanese, buffalo wings, and Mexican, but I'll pretty much eat anything. I don't buy into politics that much because I don't like politicians, so I guess I'm a moderate perhaps. If you want to know anything else about me just [facebook me](http://www.facebook.com/jesse.klein.37/) or ask me in person I suppose. See you in class!
