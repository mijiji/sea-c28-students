#Henry Howes

I am a recent graduate from the University of Washington, having majored in
History and Economics. After graduation, I fell into the entirely unrelated
field of mapmaking, where I learned some of the basics of modern cartography.

In the last year, I've become interested in programming, initially through
online demos and later in the *slightly*  more formalized setting of the
community college classroom. This fall, I narrowly avoided returning to my
alma mater for a second bachelor's degree, opting instead to pursue a more
practical, I hope, course of study at Code Fellows.

##Programming Experience
*Java - I learned the basics of object-oriented programming in two
	introductory courses at Bellevue College. I find I enjoyed
	this style of coding more than vanilla web design/development.

*HTML/CSS - I've learned the basics of HTML and CSS as a web development
	    intern at my current job. You can certainly make pretty things
	    if you know what you're doing but it's a bit dull.

*Python - My experience with Python is limited to what I've picked up
	  through the available courses at [Team Treehouse] (https://http://teamtreehouse.com/home)
	  but I'm intrigued by the neatness and elegance of the language
	  and am excited to learn more.
