##Coding Experience

Should have been coding for the past 30 years nonstop but didn't.  Glad I'm finally doing it.

As I mentioned in class I started in LOGO on an Apple IIe in the 2nd grade about 30 years ago (oi vey) and then did a little BASIC and PASCAL in HS.  Then a couple years ago I wrote a small program in AutoHotKey.  I am now quite looking forward to working on advanced projects that are fun and hopefully useful to others, from the pythons.  :D

##Goals

I hope to make a living as a freelance coder, and hopefully right away. A lofty goal I suspect but you miss every goal you don't aim for.

I like coding, I enjoy making code, particularly desktop apps, and stuff for modding games.  I also enjoy the idea of making games, so there may be some of that in my personal time but I think I'm probably quite interested in writing unique, useful applications for small businesses.  Stuff where I can come in on my own, tackle a problem from start to finish, and make something elegant and awesome and, importantly, lucrative.  :)
