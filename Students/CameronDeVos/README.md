#Cameron de Vos

## Career Travels:
Hello! Time to learn about me in my README! I grew up on the Eastside. Redmond and Kirkland was where I spent most of my days until I graduated with a business management and operations degree. A internship my senior year turned into a full time job as a database manager in downtown Seattle. I have been with my company for 3 years analyzing data, integrating applications, and building a strong company foundation. After 2 years I gave into the commute and moved to South Lake Union. A majority of me misses the Eastside and its free parking.

## Fun Details:
I spend most of my free time playing soccer, exploring the beautiful mountains we have in Washington, following technology news, having fun in video games, learning new things, and eating big bowls of macaroni and cheese.
